Tree C#
A Python script that enables you to see dependencies of a C# solution with a tree display.

## Open a terminal in full screen.
- Clone this github repository in the path of your choice: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alassane8/TreeCSharp.git
```
- Go to the BattleShip folder :
```bash
cd TreeCSharp/code
```
- Run the script: 
```bash
python script.py
```
## How to use th Script
You are now ready to use the script ! The goal is to enter the path to your .sln 
file which is the solution file that registers all the projects dependences of your 
C# solution.
From there, different files will be created where you placed 'script.py'.
